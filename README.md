## Hello!
I am a self-taught engineer and Computer Scientist. I've always been fascinated by systems and logical thinking. My interest in developing my rational thinking skills grew as I encountered tools that enabled me to recognize patterns. I wrote my first line of code when I was around 14 or 15 years old, and I haven't stopped coding since. It just naturally resonated with the way my mind works.
Over the years, I've created hundreds of projects using a wide range of technologies and patterns that I've learned along the way. Admittedly, I've also forgotten quite a few of them, haha. When necessary, I have coded using the following languages (some of which are frameworks), that I can recall at the moment:
- Lua
- Python
- C
- C++
- C#
- Sourcepawn (lol)
- Haskell
- Go
- Dart
- Flutter
- JavaScript (and a myriad of frameworks as needed)
- PHP
- Kotlin
- Bash
- SQL

Roughly 98% of my projects were never saved and have probably been deleted. I'm currently working to rectify this by using Git. Most of the projects I work on these days are either low-level or passion projects. I plan on uploading them here as they get completed.
