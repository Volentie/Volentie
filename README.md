## Hello!
I am a self-taught engineer and Computer Scientist. I've always been fascinated by systems and logical thinking. My interest in developing my rational thinking skills grew as I encountered tools that enabled me to recognize patterns. I wrote my first line of code when I was around 14 or 15 years old, and I haven't stopped coding since. It just naturally resonated with the way my mind works.
Over the years, I've created hundreds of projects using a wide range of technologies and patterns that I've learned along the way.
