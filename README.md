## Hi, my name is Gustavo.
##### My first programming language was 'Lua', afterwards I moved to other languages.

I programmed with a lot of frameworks and also built some, had been programming several languages as well but quickly moved on.

Languages I domain:
- :snake: Python
- :full_moon: Lua
- :spider_web: Web basic languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript)

I have a general understanding of networking and I'm also into hacking.

I love hard algorithm and I'm studying machine learning as well.

That's all! :rose:
