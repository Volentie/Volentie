## Hello!
I'm a self-taught engineer and computer scientist with a passion for systems, logic, and problem-solving. My curiosity for how things work led me to programming at around 14 or 15, and I’ve been coding ever since. It just made sense and fit the way I think.

Over the years, I’ve worked on hundreds of projects, exploring different technologies, architectures, and patterns. I love breaking things down, finding connections, and building solutions that make sense.

### Go Programming Language (`net/html`)  
Added support for the `<search>` tag in Go’s HTML parser. This ensures proper parsing and brings the library in line with HTML5.
